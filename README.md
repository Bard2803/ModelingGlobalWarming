# ModelingGlobalWarming

President-elect Donald Trump said in 2012 that he believed climate change was a hoax created by China. 
In this pset, we will attempt to prove him wrong. We will use regression analysis to model the climate of 
different areas in the United States in order to find evidence of global warming.

●First, you will create models to analyze and visualize climate change in terms of temperature, and then consider ways to make the
data less noisy and obtain clearer temperature change trends. 

●You will then test your models to see how well historical data can predict future temperatures. 

●Lastly, you will investigate a way to model the extremity of temperature, rather than just the increasing temperature.
